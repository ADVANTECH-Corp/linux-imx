/* nan_sm.h: Internal API for calling the NAN state machine
 *
 * The NAN state machine handles NAN events that come from the
 * driver.  This driver stream emits events of many types.  We should be able
 * to register our state machine as a handler for events of type
 * EV_ID_NAN_GENERIC, but that API doesn't exist yet.  So we call the state
 * machine explicitly.  For this, we need a proper header file.

 * @brief process NAN events and advance the state machine
 *
 * This is the main NAN state machine.  It handles events from different event
 * spaces.  Events from the NAN_EVENTS_DRIVER space come from the driver and
 * have ID == EV_ID_NAN_GENERIC.
 *
 * Calls to this function must be serialized.  At this time, we depend on the
 * fact that there is a single event loop to serialize this.  If multiple event
 * sources emerge, some sort of locking will have to be implemented.
