/* mwu module "mlocation"
 *
 * The mlocation module is meant as a model module to demonstrate the internal
 * module API for developers wishing to add wireless utilities to the suite.
 *
 * Any message sent via mwu_send_message() with "module=mlocation" will be
 * routed to the mlocation module and must have "cmd=<cmd>" as it's next
 * key-value pair.  Any message received via mwu_recv_message() with
 * module=mlocation is an event from the mlocation module and will have
 * event=<event> as its second key-value pair.
 *
 * <cmd> can be one of the following:
 *
 * ping: This is simply a mlocation command that the control program can use to
 * ensure that it is connected to mwu.  The mlocation module always returns a
 * single key-value pair in the response message: status=<status>.  <status> is
 * the base-ten ascii representation of one of the status codes defined below.
 * If <status> is MLOCATION_SUCCESS, the user can expect a pong event (see
 * below).
 *
 * <event> will be one of the following:
 *
 * pong: Somebody sent a message with "cmd=ping".  This is the response.
