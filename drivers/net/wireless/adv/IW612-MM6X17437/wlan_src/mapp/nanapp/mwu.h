/* mwu.h: API to interface with the NXP Wireless Utilities
 *
 * This file provides a unified command interface for communicating with the
 * various marvell wireless utilities such as WifiDirect (wfd) and Wifi
 * Protected Setup (wps).  After launching the mwu daemon (which is previously
 * called wfdd for legacy reasons), a control program can connect to the daemon
 * by calling mwu_connect().  Upon a successful return from this function, the
 * control program can send commands to and receive events from the various
 * utilities using the mwu_send_message() and mwu_recv_message() functions
 * respectively.  Finally, after it no longer wishes to use the utilities, the
 * control program must call mwu_disconnect().
 *
 * All messages, regardless of whether they are commands, responses to
 * commands, or events, are formatted as null-terminated ascii strings.  These
 * strings contain key-value pairs that are separated by an '=' char and
 * terminated with a '\n' char.  Further, all messages sent via
 * mwu_send_message() must have at least one key value pair, and the first
 * key-value pair must be module=<module>.  Similarly, all messages returned
 * via mwu_recv_message() are guaranteed to have at least one key-value pair,
 * and the first key-value pair is always module=<module>.  <module> must be
 * one of the supported modules described below under SUPPORTED MODULES.  The
 * remaining key-value pairs depend on the <module>.
 *
 * Developers who wish to add new SUPPORTED MODULES should read mwu_internal.h.
 * Users who wish to create custom control programs should study mwu_cli.c.
