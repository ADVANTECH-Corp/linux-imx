/* mwu_internal.h: internal interface for mwu
 *
 * This is the internal interface that wireless modules use to communicate with
 * control programs via the mwu interface.  To receive messages sent via
 * mwu_send_message(), a module must register it's name with a suitable handler
 * by calling mwu_internal_register_module().  To send messages that will go to
 * control programs listening via mwu_recv_message(), a module must populate a
 * buffer with the desired message, then send it using mwu_internal_send().
 *
 * Before this messaging scheme can be used, mwu must be initialized by calling
 * mwu_internal_init() by the daemon.  When the daemon wishes to stop using the
 * mwu control interface, it must call mwu_internal_deinit().  It is up to the
 * daemon to ensure that mwu_internal_init() is called before any modules
 * attempt to register handlers or send events.
 *
 * Module developers adding new mwu modules should consider the following
 * guidelines:
 *
 * -- Keep in mind that your module will coexist with others.  So if you emit
 *    any log messages, you may wish to prepend your module name.
 *
 * -- You must document the message scheme used by your module.  The sensible
 *    place to do this is in a header file name mymodule.h, not in this header
 *    file or in mwu.h.  See mwu_test.h for an example.  Note how the internal
 *    documentation (e.g., how to initialize and tear down the module) is
 *    separated from the documentation meant for controller application
 *    developers (e.g., messaging format and scheme).

 * preprocessor magic to allow a macro to be passed as the maxlen argument.
 *
 * Note that the MWU_KV_MAX_* macros do not account for any trailing 0.  This
 * must be added as needed.  But they do account for the required '=' and '\n'
 *
 * Note that often scan fmt strings differ from print fmt strings.  Where a
 * MWU_KV_FMT_X and MWU_KV_SCAN_X both exist, be sure to use one for scanning
 * and the other for printing.
